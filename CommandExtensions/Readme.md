# Command Extensions
Adds a few new console commands, and provides functionality for other mods to do the same.

[See here on info on the builtin commands and how to write mods using them.](Writing-Mods.md)

### Multiplayer Compatability
Multiplayer compatability largely depends on the exact mod making use of this. Some commands are
simply incompatibly with multiplayer, anything relying on them too much will not work. Like always,
all players should make sure to be running the exact same set of mods, even more so than normally.

## Changelog

### Command Extensions v1.0
Inital Release.
