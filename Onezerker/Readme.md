## Changelog

### Onezerker v1.8
Made launching the game slightly quicker when this mod is disabled, by only loading required packages on enable.

Updated to use some of the new features from SDK version 0.7.8.    
Most notably, the enabled state is now saved over game launches.

### Onezerker v1.6
Scrolling while gunzerking is now bidirectional.    
Also contains all sorts of internal tweaks that should prevent this from affecting other player or enemies.

Updated for SDK versions 0.7.4-0.7.6.
