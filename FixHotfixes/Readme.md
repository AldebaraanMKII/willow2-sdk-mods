## Changelog
This mod is not really needed anymore, just re-save all your files in blcmm.

Adds dummy objects to reorder SHiFT services, moving hotfixes back to index 6.

Note that this solution is *not* stable, and will likely break if Gearbox reorders services again.

### Fix Hotfixes v1.1
Updated to use some of the new features from SDK version 0.7.8.

### Fix Hotfixes v1.0
Inital Release.
