&nbsp;

A repo holding all my Borderlands 2/TPS [PythonSDK](https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK) mods.

While I may release each mod seperately, they're really not big/different enough to justify a seperate repo for each.

If you want to contribute, make sure any changes pass `mypy` and `flake8` checks when using the provided `requirements.txt` and `setup.cfg`.
If you're editing a library, also make sure to update the docstrings.
